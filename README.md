# SearchNews

Description: Due to this current COVID-19 situation being more involved into current news, I found it hard for to search news on a particular day on a particular topic, this idea seems simple yet powerful as I tried using this for variety of reasons like in various sectors. This app “SearchNews” can take a query keyword and a date to search news on that topic on that particular day. On app launch will show today’s news

Features:
1.	Open app to show news on the current date
2.	Update news according to the country that the app is used in
3.	Without a valid keyword and without a valid date app shows Top stories for today
4.	Without a valid keyword and a valid date app still shows “Today’s News”. 
5.	Search query can be regarding stocks, countries or any keyword, if there are no news on that search, list will be empty
6.	Proper Toast messages are showed


- No special instructions to run the project.

- No Third party libraries

- Only known limitation is, if we gave empty keyword and a valid date, app still shows news on Current date because of NewsAPI limitation we cannot just query news by date, it should have both keyword and date.

- Tested on Pixel 3A XL Emulator on Mac
